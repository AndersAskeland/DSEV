Capillary blood flow regulation is extremely important for the optimal function of organs especially in conditions where the oxygen supply is inadequate e.g. during ischemia. Therefore, it is of great interests to understand how capillary blood flow is regulated and possibly uncover ways to control or optimize capillary blood flow during periods of insufficient oxygen availability.

An important cell surrounding the brain capillaries are the pericyte, that can contract and thereby control the flow of red blood cells. These cells, that for long was categorized as uninteresting support cells, is now thought to play an important role in the control of capillary blood flow, blood brain barrier tightness as well as in angiogenesis.

Extra cellular vesicles (EVs) are released in the blood by a wide array of cell types. These vesicles have the potential to function as long distance signaling systems carrying messages that can impact the function of the recipient cells. An interesting group of molecules with the potential of re-programming the receiving cell is microRNAs (miRNAs). These short non-coding RNAs controls and modulates the translation of a large fraction of proteins and changes in the miRNAs will therefore have an impact on the expression profile of the cell and thereby their function.
